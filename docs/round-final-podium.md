# Round 3 – Final Podium

## Overview

Final Podium is an elimination finale designed for:
- High tension
- Visual clarity
- Comeback potential

Scores from earlier rounds are converted into **podium height**.

---

## Core Rules

- Multiple choice questions (A / B / C / D)
- All players answer every question
- Wrong answers reduce height
- First correct answer earns a height boost
- Height reaching zero results in elimination

---

## Starting Heights

- Player scores are normalized into podium heights
- Leader starts highest
- Lowest scorer receives a minimum floor to avoid instant elimination

---

## Per-Question Resolution

Each question resolves in three steps:

### 1. First Correct Answer
- First correct responder gains height
- Boost amount depends on current rank:
  - Last place gains more
  - First place gains less

### 2. Other Correct Answers
- No gain
- No loss
- Player remains safe

### 3. Wrong Answers
- Height is reduced by a fixed amount

---

## Elimination

- Height ≤ 0 triggers elimination
- Podium visibly collapses
- Eliminated players become spectators

---

## Question Timing

- 10–12 seconds per question
- Timer visible on phones and big screen
- No buzzing; everyone answers simultaneously

---

## Endgame Logic

### More Than 2 Players Remaining
- Continue normal questions

### Exactly 2 Players Remaining – Countdown Mode
- Fixed number of questions (e.g. 5)
- Heights still change
- No eliminations mid-question
- Highest podium after countdown wins

### Tie After Countdown
- Sudden death question
- First correct answer wins instantly

---

## Edge Cases

- All players wrong → everyone drops
- Multiple correct at same time → server timestamp decides first
- AFK player → treated as wrong

---

## Design Notes

- Final round favors consistency over trivia dominance
- Rubber-banding is subtle and invisible to players
- Visual drama is as important as scoring math
